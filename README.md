## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Model Size Optimization
**Problem**: Initial model size was 250MB, causing slow load times and deployment issues.

**Solution**: Implemented model quantization and pruning techniques, reducing size to 84.6MB while maintaining 92%+ accuracy. Used TensorFlow Lite conversion for further optimization.

### Challenge 2: Real-Time Audio Processing
**Problem**: Processing latency exceeded 5 seconds for longer audio files.

**Solution**: Implemented chunked processing with parallel feature extraction, reducing average processing time to <2 seconds per file.

### Challenge 3: Cross-Platform Audio Support
**Problem**: Different audio codecs caused compatibility issues across operating systems.

**Solution**: Integrated FFmpeg for universal codec support and implemented fallback mechanisms for unsupported formats.

### Challenge 4: Memory Management
**Problem**: Large spectrograms caused memory overflow on limited resources.

**Solution**: Implemented lazy loading and streaming processing for audio files, with dynamic memory allocation based on available resources.
