# CNN-Based-Music-Instrument-Recognition-System
Identifying instruments in a music track is crucial for tasks such as audio tagging, remixing, indexing, and recommendation systems. Manual labeling of instruments is time-consuming and error-prone. InstruNet AI aims to automatically detect instruments in a music track using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to audio spectrograms.
